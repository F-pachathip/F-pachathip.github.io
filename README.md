# LabCam Web App

LabCam is a simple web application for scanning reagent test strips, estimating color intensity and storing the results in a SQLite database. The interface has been restyled with a light theme inspired by common Thai school websites.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
